  <h1>2014 WorldView-2 Imagery</h1>

  	<p>This high-resolution satellite imagery shows the Barrow region as it appeared in 2014.  It has a pixel resolution of 0.5 m (1.6 ft).  Panchromatic and multispectral WorldView-2 imagery was acquired by DigitalGlobe, orthorectified and pan sharpened by E-Terra LLC, purchased by the Ukpeagvik Inupiat Corporation (UIC), and further processed by UIC project partners (the University of Colorado and the University of Texas at El Paso).
