  <h1>1979 AHAP Imagery</h1>

  <p>This imagery shows the Barrow region as it appeared in July of 1979.  The "Color Infrared" imagery is a type of false-color imagery showing water as blue, ice as white, and vegetation as red.  It has a pixel resolution of 1.7 m (5.5 ft).  The orthomosaic was created by the <a href="https://www.asf.alaska.edu/" target="_blank">Alaska Satellite Facility</a>for the <a href="http://arcticlcc.org/" target="_blank">Arctic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (ALCC)</a> using aerial photographs originally acquired by the NASA as part of the statewide Alaska High Altitude Photography Program (AHAP). The ALCC released a draft of the orthomosaic to BAID in 2013, with subsequent processing by the BAID Team.
