  <h1>2005 NPRA DOQ Imagery</h1>

  <p>This imagery shows the Barrow region as it appeared in July and August of 2005.  The "Color Infrared" imagery is a type of false-color imagery showing water as blue, ice as white, and vegetation as red.  It has a pixel resolution of 2.5 m (8.2 ft).  Aerial photographs across much of northern Alaska were acquired, orthorectified, and then released by the USGS as part of the Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle (DOQ) series.  The DOQ's can be downloaded as tiles from the <a href="http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">USGS EarthExplorer application</a> Sixteen tiles of the DOQ imagery were further processed by the BAID Team to create this orthophotomosaic.</p>
