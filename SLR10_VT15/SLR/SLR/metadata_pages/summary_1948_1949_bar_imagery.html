  <h1>1948-1949 BAR Imagery</h1>

  <p>This high-resolution black and white image portrays the Barrow region as it appeared in 1948 and 1949.  It has a pixel resolution of 0.5 m (1.6 ft).  Over 390 aerial photographs were acquired originally by the US Navy as part of the “BAR” series, released as digital scans by the USGS EDC, and then fully orthorectified by the BAID Team to create this orthophotomosaic.</p>
