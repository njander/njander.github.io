  <h1>1955 Black & White Imagery</h1>

  <p>This high-resolution black and white image portrays the Barrow region as it appeared on August 12th and August 14th, 1955.  It has a pixel resolution of 1.3 m (4.3 ft).  Seventy six aerial photographs were acquired originally by the US Air Force as part of a statewide series, released as digital scans from the USGS EDC, and then fully orthorectified by the BAID Team to create this orthophotomosaic.</p>
